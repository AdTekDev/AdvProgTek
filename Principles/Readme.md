### Implications for Coders

- A great programmer can solve some problems that the average programmer simply cannot solve. In some instances, this makes them infinitely times more productive.
- A great programmer can write code that is 10,000 times faster than the code of an average programmer.
- A great programmer writes code with fewer bugs. Think about the effect of a single security bug on Microsoft’s reputation and brand! Moreover, every additional bug costs time, energy, and money for subsequent modifications of the codebase and feature additions—the detrimental, compounding effect of bugs.
- A great programmer writes code that is easier to extend, which may improve the productivity of thousands of developers that work on the
code at a later stage of the software development process.
- A great programmer thinks out of the box and finds creative solutions to circumvent costly development efforts and help focus on the most important things.

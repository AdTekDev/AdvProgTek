# W08 - Routine, Variables & Data Types

## Refactor and Validate Code

Refactoring a piece of code to adhere to best programming practices. This includes renaming variables and methods according to coding standards and checking the data types of variables and the validity of input values.

## Tasks:

**Variable and Method Names:**   
Review the existing code and ensure that variable and method names follow proper naming conventions. Rename them if necessary to make the code more readable and maintainable.

**Variable Type Checking:**   
Examine the data types of variables used in the code. Ensure that variables are appropriately typed to represent the data they hold. If any discrepancies are found, adjust the variable types accordingly.

**Input Validation:**   
Evaluate the code for user inputs. Implement validation checks to ensure that the input values are valid and fall within the expected range. For example, if you expect an integer, validate that the input is indeed an integer and within acceptable limits.


## Criteria:

- Clarity and consistency of variable and method names.
- Corrected variable data types.
- Effective input validation.
- Explanation of changes and validation methods used.

## Naming Variables  

General Naming Considerations  
❑ Does the name fully and accurately describe what the variable represents?    
❑ Does the name refer to the real-world problem rather than to the programming-language solution?  
❑ Is the name long enough that you don’t have to puzzle it out?  
❑ Are computed-value qualifiers, if any, at the end of the name?  
❑ Does the name use Count or Index instead of Num?  


Naming Specific Kinds of Data  
❑ Are loop index names meaningful (something other than i, j, or k if the loop is more than one or two lines long or is nested)?  
❑ Have all “temporary” variables been renamed to something more meaningful?  
❑ Are boolean variables named so that their meanings when they’re true are clear?  
❑ Do enumerated-type names include a prefix or suffix that indicates the category—for example, Color_ for Color_Red, Color_Green, Color_Blue, and so on?  
❑ Are named constants named for the abstract entities they represent rather than the numbers they refer to?  


Naming Conventions  
❑ Does the convention distinguish among local, class, and global data?  
❑ Does the convention distinguish among type names, named constants, enumerated types, and variables?  
❑ Does the convention identify input-only parameters to routines in languages that don’t enforce them?   
❑ Is the convention as compatible as possible with standard conventions for the language?   
❑ Are names formatted for readability?


Short Names  
❑ Does the code use long names (unless it’s necessary to use short ones)?  
❑ Does the code avoid abbreviations that save only one character?  
❑ Are all words abbreviated consistently?  
❑ Are the names pronounceable?  
❑ Are names that could be misread or mispronounced avoided?  
❑ Are short names documented in translation tables?  


Common Naming Problems: Have You Avoided...  
❑ ...names that are misleading?  
❑ ...names with similar meanings?  
❑ ...names that are different by only one or two characters?  
❑ ...names that sound similar?  
❑ ...names that use numerals?  
❑ ...names intentionally misspelled to make them shorter?  
❑ ...names that are commonly misspelled in English?  
❑ ...names that conflict with standard library routine names or with predefined variable names?  
❑ ...totally arbitrary names?  
❑ ...hard-to-read characters?
